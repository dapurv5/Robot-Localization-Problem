In this project we explore the various algorithms for the Robot Localization Problem and build a simulator to visualize the results on
various 2D maps.
Robot localization is an important problem in robotics. Simply put, the robot localization problem is as follows. A robot is 
placed at an unknown point inside a simple polygon $ P $. The robot has a map of 
$ P$ and can compute visibility polygon from its current location. The robot must determine its correct 
location inside the polygon $P $ at a minimum cost of travel distance. We implement an ${O(\log^3 n)} $ factor approximation algorithm 
as given by \cite{key1}. Computational Geometry Algorithms Library \cite{CGAL} has been used for the various computational geometry
 algorithms.
