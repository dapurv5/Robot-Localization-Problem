\section{Introduction to Reference Points}
\begin{definition}
 {\bf Reference Points:} are the discrete set of points on the edges of $\partial K_{i} \cap \partial G_{i}$  which are used to determine the
  half localization path of robot.   
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
 {\bf Half Localization Path:} is the path travelling along which the robot can eliminate half of the hypotheses by making
 observations at the reference points.
\end{definition}

For example,

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\scalebox{0.50}{\includegraphics{Images/reference.png}}
\caption{\label{fig:Reference Points}Reference Points in blue color and hypotheses in green color}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The reference points shown in the figure are for the hypothesis $h_0$. The robot on following the path from $h_0$ to $R_0$ 
can differentiate between hypotheses $\{h_0,h_1,h_2\}$ and $\{h_3, h_4\}$ based on its observation at $R_0$. The path shown in black is the half computing path.

\section{Algorithm}

\begin{enumerate}
 \item For every $i$ find those edges in $K_i$ which are not part of the boundary of majority map. These are important edges on which
we will find out reference points. Let $L_i$ contains all these edges for a particular $i$.
 \item  Calculate $r_0$(geodesic) radius of the smallest geodesic disk centered on $\gamma_{0}$ that intersects at least half of $L_{i}'s$.
\begin{enumerate}
 \item For all $i$ calculate the minimum distance between $\gamma_{0}$ and any of the line segments of $L_i$.
 \item Take the median of all the distances calculated above as the geodesic radius$(r_0)$. 
\end{enumerate}
 \item 
\end{enumerate}
