\chapter{OpenGL}

OpenGL (Open Graphics Library)[\cite{OpenGL}] is a standard specification defining a cross-language, cross-platform API for writing applications that produce 2D and 3D computer graphics.\\

GLUI[\cite{GLUI}] is a GLUT-based C++ user interface library which provides controls such as buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons, and spinners to OpenGL applications. It is window-system independent, relying on GLUT to handle all system-dependent issues, such as window and mouse management.
The visual component of the project was handled using OpenGL [see red book] and GLUI panel.

OpenGL supports convex polygons. It doesnâ€™t support concave polygons by default. Since our project requires drawing concave polygons we have used tessellation feature to break concave polygons into a series of triangles.
Code Snippet for Tessellation.
