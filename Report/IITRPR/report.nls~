 \nomgroup{G}

  \item [{$\gamma$}]\begingroup A point inside the polygon with origin choosen at one of the hypotheses.
		\nompageref{1}

 \nomgroup{Z}

  \item [{$H$}]\begingroup A list of points which denotes potential robot positions.
\nompageref{1}

\item [{$P_{maj}$}] \begingroup The majority rule map of all translates of the polygon. The
translates of the polygon are obtained by choosing one hypothesis as the origin and
translating all the remaining hypotheses to this chosen origin.
\nompageref{1}

  \item [{$G_{ij}$}]\begingroup For the translates corresponding to pair of hypotheses $h_{i}$ and
 $h_{j}$, $G_{ij}$ is the origin containing region obtained by taking the lower
envelope of visibility polygons of all type 1 and type 2 edges of the union-polygon.\\
An edge is of type 1 or type 2, if it belongs to exactly one of the translates.
\nompageref{1}

  \item [{$g_{i}$}]\begingroup Set of all points at which $h_{i}$ does not share the majority
opinion about $i$.
\nompageref{1}

  \item [{$K_{i}$}]\begingroup The majority rule map of $G_{ij}$'s
\nompageref{1}

  \item [{$Maj(\gamma)$}]\begingroup Set of hypothesis which share the majority opinion about $\gamma$.
