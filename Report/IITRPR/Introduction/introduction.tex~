\nomenclature[H]{$H$}{ A list of points which denotes potential robot positions.}                  

\nomenclature[Pmaj]{$P_{maj}$}{The majority rule map of all translates of the polygon. The
translates of the polygon are obtained by choosing one hypothesis as the origin and
translating all the remaining hypotheses to this chosen origin.}                               

\nomenclature[Gij]{$G_{ij}$}{ For the translates corresponding to pair of hypotheses $h_{i}$ and
 $h_{j}$, $G_{ij}$ is the origin containing region obtained by taking the lower
envelope of visibility polygons of all type 1 and type 2 edges of the polygon.\\
An edge is of type 1 or type 2, if it belongs to exactly one of the translates.
}                         

\nomenclature[gi]{$g_{i}$}{The set of all points at which $h_{i}$ does not share the majority
opinion about $i$.}          

\nomenclature[Ki]{$K_{i}$}{The majority rule map of $G_{ij}$'s}  
\nomenclature[Maj(gamma)]{$Maj(\gamma)$}{Set of hypothesis which share the majority opinion about $\gamma$.
 $\gamma$ can be either a point or a region.} 


{\bf Input:}\\
Map polygon $P$, the visibility polygon $V$.
\\
{\bf Output:}\\
The robot localizes to its actual position $h \in H$

\begin{algorithmic}[1]
  \STATE Compute the set of hypotheses $H$.
 \WHILE{ $ | H | > 1$ } 
  \STATE Compute the majority-rule map $P_{maj}$
  \STATE Compute the polygons $G_{ij}$ for each pair of hypotheses, $h_{i}$ and $h_{j}$
  \STATE Compute the majority rule map $K_{i}$ of $G_{ij}$'s
  \STATE Find the edges on the boundary of $K_{i}$ which are not on the boundary of $P_{maj}$
  \STATE Draw grids and compute the set of coordinates $Q_{H}$ on these edges.
  \STATE Make instance $I_{P,H}$  of $\frac{1}{2}$ -Group Steiner Problem
  \STATE Solve $I_{P,H}$ to compute a half computing path $C \subset P_{maj}$
  \STATE Half-Localize by tracing $C $ and making observations at coordinates $Q_{H}$
  \STATE Move back to the starting location.
 \ENDWHILE
